title: Serial cable for Raspberry Pi 2 B

I have two or three Raspberry Pi 2 B single board computers. I've had them a
long time and they've mostly been gathering dust. I now plan to make use of
them. I want to work with them efficiently, so inspired by this [2021 blog post]
I decided to buy a [USB to serial converter]. Another popular author and
YouTuber has [written about the same topic]. The serial converter cost about £10
and should be delivered in a few days. In doing a little research before the
purchase, I looked at the [schematic] and I learnt:

> The remaining pins are all general-purpose 3V3 pins, meaning that the outputs
> are set to 3.3 volts and the inputs are tolerant of 3.3 volts.

I also came across a [forum post] with reassuring, beginner friendly,
explanation about serial communication.

I have ordered a couple of [cases] too.
